Problem Statement

Shreya is a student who needs to calculate her exam percentage. Her regular percentage is calculated using the formula (obtained marks / total marks) * 100. However, as a scholarship student, she receives an additional 5% bonus on her calculated percentage. 

Write a program that uses an overridden method calculatePercentage to compute both her regular and scholarship percentages.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, which represents the total marks in the exam.

The second line consists of an integer m, which represents the marks obtained by the student.

Output format :
The first line of output displays a double value, representing the percentage of marks obtained by the regular student, rounded to two decimal places.

The second line displays a double value, representing the percentage of marks obtained by the scholarship student, rounded to two decimal places.

Solution:-

import java.util.*;

class Student{
    int obtained_marks;
    int total_marks;

    Student(){

    }

    Student(int obtained_marks, int total_marks){
        this.obtained_marks = obtained_marks;
        this.total_marks = total_marks;
    }

    double calculatePercentage(){
        return ((double)obtained_marks/total_marks)*100;
    }

}

class Scholarship extends Student{
    double additional = 0.05;

    Scholarship(int obtained_marks, int total_marks){
        this.obtained_marks = obtained_marks;
        this.total_marks = total_marks;
    }

    double calculatePercentage(){
        return (((double)obtained_marks/total_marks)*100)+additional;
    }

}

class Main{

    public static void main(String[] args){

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter total marks: ");
        int total_marks = input.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Enter obtained marks: ");
        int obtained_marks = input.nextInt();

        Student s0 = new Student(obtained_marks,total_marks);

        double result0 = s0.calculatePercentage();

        System.out.printf("Normal student: %.2f",result0);

        Student s1 = new Scholarship(obtained_marks,total_marks);

        double result1 = s1.calculatePercentage();

        System.out.printf("\nScholarship student: %.2f",result1);

    }
}

Sample Input/Output:

Enter total marks: 
100
Enter obtained marks: 
80
Normal student: 80.00%
Scholarship student: 80.05%
