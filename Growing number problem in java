/*Problem Statement

Define an interface Growing which declares the method isGrowing().

Create a class GrowingNumber which implements the interface. Override the method isGrowing() to check if the given number is a growing number or not.
A growing number is a number where each digit is larger than the digit to its left.  For example, 369 is a growing number but 362 is not.

Create another class GrowingString which also implements the same interface. Override the method isGrowing() to check whether the given string is growing string or not.
If on moving from left to right, each character in the string comes after the previous character in alphabetical order. 
For example, ANT is a growing string whereas APPLE is not. 

Write a Java program to check whether the given number is a growing number or not and whether the given string is a growing string or not.

Input format :
The input consists of a number followed by a string separated by space.

Output format :
The first line of output prints whether the given number is a growing number or not.

The second line prints whether the given string is a growing string or not.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The input string consists of uppercase characters.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
369 ANT
Output 1 :
Growing number
Growing string

Input 2 :
369 APPLE
Output 2 :
Growing number
Not growing string
