/*Problem Statement

Rock is developing a real-time multiplayer game where players can communicate with each other through an in-game messaging system. 
The game features a messaging system with an abstract class Message and a subclass Email for sending in-game emails.

Develop a program to help Rock that solicits user input, capturing information such as sender and recipient addresses, subject, and body of a message.
Subsequently, the program presents the collected details back to the user.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a string, representing the sender's email address.

The second line consists of a string, representing the recipient's email address.

The third line consists of a string, representing the subject of the mail.

The fourth line consists of a string, representing the body of the mail.

Output format :
The output displays the information about the mail in the following format:

"Email Format

From: [sender]

To: [recipient]

Subject: [subject]

Body: [body]

Email sent!"



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The maximum length of the string is 1000.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
JohnDoe
JaneSmith
Greetings
Hello Jane, how are you?
Output 1 :
Email Format
From: JohnDoe
To: JaneSmith
Subject: Greetings
Body: Hello Jane, how are you?
Email sent!
Input 2 :
Organizer
Players
Game Tomorrow
Friendly reminder about our Game tomorrow at 2 PM!
Output 2 :
Email Format
From: Organizer
To: Players
Subject: Game Tomorrow
Body: Friendly reminder about our Game tomorrow at 2 PM!
Email sent!

Solution:-

import java.util.*;

abstract class Message{
    abstract void display();
}

class Email extends Message{

    String sender_email_id;
    String recipient_email_id;
    String subject;
    String body;

    Email(String sender_email_id,String recipient_email_id,String subject, String body){
        this.sender_email_id = sender_email_id;
        this.recipient_email_id = recipient_email_id;
        this.subject = subject;
        this.body = body;
    }

    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Email format");
        System.out.println("From: "+sender_email_id);
        System.out.println("To: "+recipient_email_id);
        System.out.println("Subject: "+subject);
        System.out.println("Body: "+body);
        System.out.println("Email sent!!");
    }
}

class Main{

    public static void main(String[] args){

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter sender email: ");
        String sender_email_id = input.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Enter recipient email: ");
        String recipient_email_id= input.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Enter subject: ");
        String subject= input.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Enter body: ");
        String body= input.nextLine();


        Email e1 = new Email(sender_email_id,recipient_email_id,subject,body);

        e1.display();

    }
}
