/*Problem Statement



Hari is working on a Java program for his homework to calculate the sum of two and three integers. 



Write a program that allows Hari to input two integers and three integers separately. Use overloaded methods called sum to calculate and display the sum for each case.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of two space-separated integers m and n.

The second line consists of three space-separated integers a, b and c.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Sum of two integers: " followed by the sum of m and n.

The second line prints "Sum of three integers: " followed by the sum of a, b and c.

Input 1 :
12 34 
56 78 63
Output 1 :
Sum of two integers: 46
Sum of three integers: 197


Input 2 :
523 178 
481 989 124
Output 2 :
Sum of two integers: 701
Sum of three integers: 1594
