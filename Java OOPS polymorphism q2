Problem Statement
A new airline, Boeing747, needs to calculate its total revenue based on ticket cost and seat availability. 
Implement a program using three classes: Airline, Indigo, and Boeing747, where Airline has a cost attribute, 
Indigo extends Airline with seatAvailability, and Boeing747 extends Indigo with a method calculateTotalRevenue to calculate the total revenue.

Note: Total revenue = ticket cost * seat availability

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a double value, representing the flight's ticket cost.

The second line consists of an integer, representing seat availability.

Output format :
The output prints the ticket cost, seat availability and the total revenue.

Input 1 :
1000.0
100
Output 1 :
Ticket Cost: Rs. 1000.0
Seat Availability: 100 seats
Total Revenue: Rs. 100000.0

Input 2 :
22000.0
300
Output 2 :
Ticket Cost: Rs. 22000.0
Seat Availability: 300 seats
Total Revenue: Rs. 6600000.0

Input 3 :
50000.00
30
Output 3 :
Ticket Cost: Rs. 50000.0
Seat Availability: 30 seats
Total Revenue: Rs. 1500000.0

class Airline{
    double cost;
    
    Airline(){
        
    }
    
    Airline(double cost){
        this.cost = cost;
    }
    
    
}

class Indigo extends Airline{
    int sa;
    
    Indigo(){
        
    }
    
    Indigo(int sa, double cost){
        this.sa = sa;
        this.cost = cost;
    }
    
}

class Boeing747 extends Indigo{
    double revenue;
    
    Boeing747(int sa,double cost){
        super(sa,cost);
        this.revenue = revenue;
    }
    
    public void calculateTotalRevenue(){
        revenue = cost*sa;
        System.out.printf("Ticket Cost: Rs. %.1f",cost);
        System.out.println("\nSeat Availability: "+sa+" seats");
        System.out.printf("Total Revenue: Rs. %.1f",revenue);
    }
    
}

class Main{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        double cost = input.nextDouble();
        
        int sa = input.nextInt();
        
        Boeing747 b1 = new Boeing747(sa,cost);
        
        b1.calculateTotalRevenue();

    }
}
