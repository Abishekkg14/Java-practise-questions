/*Problem Statement
Riya is a teacher who is passionate about assessing her students fairly. 
She is developing a program to calculate the grades of her students based on their test scores. 
Implement a program that models the grade calculation of a student. 

Follow the class hierarchy and details provided below:
Person Class:
Create a class named Person with protected instance variables firstName, lastName, and idNumber.
Create a constructor in the Person class that takes three parameters (firstName, lastName, and idNumber) and initializes the instance variables.
Implement a method named printPerson in the Person class that prints the name and ID of the person.

Student Class: Create a class named Student that extends the Person class.
Add a private instance variable testScores, which is an array of integers representing the test scores of the student.
Create a constructor in the Student class that takes four parameters (firstName, lastName, id, and testScores) and 
calls the constructor of the superclass using the super keyword.
Implement a method named calculate() in the Student class that calculates and returns the grade based on the average of the test scores.


Main Class:
In the Main class, use a Scanner to take input for the firstName, lastName, id, and the number of test scores (numScores).
Take input for the test scores and create an object of the Student class using the provided input values.
Invoke the printPerson method on the Student object to print the name and ID of the student.
Invoke the calculate method on the Student object to calculate and print the grade.

The grading scale is as follows:
  Grading Scale

+--------+-------------------+
| Letter | Average (a)       |
+--------+-------------------+
| O      | 90 ≤ a ≤ 100      |
| A      | 80 ≤ a < 90       |
| E      | 70 ≤ a < 80       |
| P      | 55 ≤ a < 70       |
| D      | 40 ≤ a < 55       |
| T      | a < 40            |
+--------+-------------------+

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a string representing the first name.
The second line consists of a string representing the last name.
The third line consists of an integer representing the id.
The fourth line consists of the number of test scores.
The fifth line consists of an integer array of test scores, separated by a single space.

Output format :
The output displays the name, ID and grade of the student in separate lines.

Solution:-

import java.util.*;

class Person{
    protected String firstName;
    protected String lastName;
    protected int id_number;

    Person(String firstName, String lastName, int id_number){
        
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.id_number = id_number;
        
    }
    
    void printperson(){
        System.out.println("Name: "+firstName+" "+lastName);
        System.out.println("ID: "+id_number);
    }
}

class Student extends Person{
    char grade;
    private int[] scores;
    
    Student(String firstName,String lastName,int id_number,int[] scores){
        
        super(firstName,lastName,id_number);
        
        this.scores = scores;
    }
    
    char calculate(){
        int sum = 0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<scores.length; i++){
            sum+=scores[i];
        }
        
        int test_score = sum/scores.length;
        
        
        if(test_score>=90 && test_score<=100){
            grade = 'O';
        }
        else if(test_score>=80 && test_score<90){
            grade = 'E';
        }
        else if(test_score>=70 && test_score<80){
            grade = 'A';
        }
        else if(test_score>=55 && test_score<70){
            grade = 'P';
        }
        else if(test_score>=40 && test_score<55){
            grade = 'D';
        }
        else if(test_score<40){
            grade = 'T';
        }
        return grade;
    }
}

class Main{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
    
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    
        String fn = input.nextLine();
        String ln = input.nextLine();
        int id = input.nextInt();
        int n = input.nextInt();
        int[] scores = new int[n];
    
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            scores[i] = input.nextInt();
        }
        
        Student s1 = new Student(fn,ln,id,scores);
        
        char grade = s1.calculate();
        s1.printperson();
        System.out.println("Grade: "+grade);
    }   
}
