/*Problem Statement

Raj is curious about how old he is in the current year. 

He has asked you to create a simple program that calculates a person's age based on their birth year. 
You decide to implement this functionality using the AgeCalculator interface and the HumanAgeCalculator class.

Note: The current year is 2024. Calculate the current age by using the formula: current year - birth year.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer representing the birth year.

Output format :
The output displays "You are X years old." where X is an integer representing the calculated age based on the entered birth year.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1900 ≤ birth year ≤ 2022

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1934
Output 1 :
You are 90 years old.
Input 2 :
2000
Output 2 :
You are 24 years old.
Input 3 :
1986
Output 3 :
You are 38 years old.

Solution:-

import java.util.*;

interface AgeCalculator{
    void calc();
}

class HumanAgeCalculator implements AgeCalculator{
    
    int birth_year;
    
    HumanAgeCalculator(int birth_year){
        this.birth_year = birth_year;
    }
    
    public void calc(){
        int age = 2024-birth_year;
        System.out.println("You are "+age+" years old.");
    }
    
}


class Main{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int birth_year = input.nextInt();
        
        HumanAgeCalculator h1 = new HumanAgeCalculator(birth_year);
        
        h1.calc();
        
    }
    
}
