/*Problem Statement



John wants to determine the travel distance his car can cover based on its speed and fuel capacity. 



Write a program that reads the speed and fuel capacity, and calculates the travel distance using a Car class that extends a Vehicle class. The Vehicle class should contain speed and fuel capacity attributes, while the Car class should have a method calculateTravelDistance() to calculate the travel distance.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a double value, representing the speed.

The second line consists of a double value, representing the fuel capacity.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Speed: X km/h" where X is a double value, representing the speed, rounded off to two decimal places.

The second line prints "Fuel Capacity: Y liters" where Y is a double value, representing the fuel capacity, rounded off to two decimal places.

The third line prints "Travel Distance: Z km" where Z is a double value, representing the total distance, rounded off to two decimal places.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10.0
1.0
Output 1 :
Speed: 10.00 km/h
Fuel Capacity: 1.00 liters
Travel Distance: 10.00 km

Input 2 :
456.90
12.54
Output 2 :
Speed: 456.90 km/h
Fuel Capacity: 12.54 liters
Travel Distance: 5729.53 km

Input 3 :
150.75
9.8
Output 3 :
Speed: 150.75 km/h
Fuel Capacity: 9.80 liters
Travel Distance: 1477.35 km

class Vehicle{
    double speed;
    double fuel;
    
    Vehicle(){
        
    }
    
    Vehicle(double speed, double fuel){
        this.speed = speed;
        this.fuel = fuel;
    }
    
}

class Car extends Vehicle{
    
    Car(double speed,double fuel){
        super(speed,fuel);
    }
    
    void calculateTravelDistance(){
        double distance = speed*fuel;
        System.out.printf("\nTravel Distance: %.2f km",distance);
    }
    
    void display(){
        System.out.printf("Speed: %.2f km/h",speed);
        System.out.printf("\nFuel Capacity: %.2f liters",fuel);
    }
    
}


class Main{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        double speed = input.nextDouble();
        double fuel = input.nextDouble();
        
        
        Car c1 = new Car(speed,fuel);
        
        c1.display();
        c1.calculateTravelDistance();
        
    }
    
}
