Problem Statement

Teena's retail store has implemented a Loyalty Points System to reward customers based on their spending. The program includes two classes: Customer and PremiumCustomer.

For regular customers: Loyalty points = amount spent / 10

For premium customers: Loyalty points = 2 * (amount spent / 10)

Calculate and display the loyal points received by the customers using an overridden method calculateLoyaltyPoints.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer representing the amount spent by the customer.

The second line consists of premium customer status (a string) - "yes" if the customer is a premium customer, "no" if they are not.

Output format :
The output displays the loyalty points earned based on the amount spent.

Solution:-

import java.util.*;

class Customer{
    
    public int calculateLoyaltyPoints(int amount){
        return (amount/10);
    }
    
}

class PremiumCustomer extends Customer{
    
    public int calculateLoyaltyPoints(int amount){
        return 2*(amount/10);
    }
    
}

class Main{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int amount = input.nextInt();
        
        input.nextLine();
        
        String status = input.nextLine().toLowerCase();
        
        if(status.equals("yes")){
            
            Customer p1 = new PremiumCustomer();
            
            int result = p1.calculateLoyaltyPoints(amount);
            
            System.out.println(result);
            
        }
        else if(status.equals("no")){
            
            Customer c1 = new Customer();
            
            int result2 = c1.calculateLoyaltyPoints(amount);
            
            System.out.println(result2);
        }
    }
}
